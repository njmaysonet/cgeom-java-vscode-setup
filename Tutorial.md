# Setting up Java for VS Code

You will need a JDK of your choice downloaded and either installed or uncompressed on your computer.

You can also follow the excellent guide by [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial).

# Install Extensions

Download the official Microsoft extensions for full Java support in VS Code. You'll need **Project Manager for Java** in order to manage your Java projects and create packages.
